## Prerequisites
* A computer ! preferably running [Linux](https://linux.org/), because Linux is good, after all. Isn't ?
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), a fast, disk space efficient package manager


## Pnpm install

If you are still using npm, the package manager provided by default with Node.js, I invite you to use pnpm. It's the same, but (really) much faster. Let's install pnpm globally.

```
npm install -g pnpm
```

## Installation

Of course, clone this repo or download/unzip the zip archive, as usual. Then, enter the directory and install the dependencies.

```
cd shoelace-lit-boilerplate
pnpm i
```

## Run
```
pnpm start
```

Then, open your favorite browser and go to https://localhost:8085/


## Basic demo features

* some simples pages
* a theme changer using localstorage
* a login page
* client side routing using @vaading/router
  * handle 404
* webpack reverse proxy

## More features ?

Just open a ticket ;)
